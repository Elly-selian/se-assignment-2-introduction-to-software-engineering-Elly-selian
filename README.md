# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
This is a branch ofcomputer science that deals with the design,development,testing, and maintainance of software application.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering extend the entire cycle of software from conception to maintainance while traditional programming was more of manual writting of  codes to create specific instruction for a computer to follow.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
This is  a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low cost software, in shortest posible production line. the cycle stages are; Planning and requirements,defining requirements, design, Development, and testing, deployment and then  Maintainance.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1.planning: this is were developer define the problem,and scope and objectives for the system.
2.analysis:this involves gathering of specific details required forthe new system, define prototype system requirements.
3.design:this explains how the project should look like interms of operatios,maintainance and will be refference through out the next stages.
4.development:this is actual writing of codes and building of application.
5.testing:this is basicaly fine tuning to ensure if there are defects that will be tracked later reyested.
6.implementation:this is the intergration of the system into the environment and enventually is installation.
7.maintainance: this is tracking and maintaining any changes after the the software have been deployed.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
AGILE-Is iterative and incremental approach to poject management and software development.
It emphasizes flexibility,collaboration and customer feeddback.While WATERFALL is a linear and sequential approach where each face must complete befpore the next begins.
AGILE can be used for starting new projects, projects with shorter turnaround and team adaptability.
WATERFALL can best be used in a scenario where large scale manufacturing operation where all component parts need to be identified,designed,and moved to manufacturingat roughlythe same time.there is no room for alteration.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirement engineering is the process of defining,documenting, and aintaining requirements in the engineering design process.
Its importance is that it helps software engineers better comprehend the problem they are working on.
the process includes, feasebility study,requirements elicitation,requirementspecification,requirement for verificationand validation,requirement management.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
modularity conceptis a principle aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of system.
modulary concept divide software into distict modules, developers can manage, update and scale parts of application idependently leading to more efficient maintainance and easier scalability.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing- thisis the process of testing the smallest functional unit of code which ensure code quality.
2. integration testing- this involves testing of multiple parts of software system as a group.
3. System testing- this examines every component of an application to make sure that they work as a complete and unified whole.
4. Acceptance testing enables t organization to engage end users in the testing process and gather their feedback to relay to developers.
Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source codes overtime.
1. Git- high speed, data integrity and support for distributed workflows.
2. Apache subversion- its a centralized system.all files and historical data are stored on a central server.
3. Beanstalk-its based on browser and cloud,it can be integared with messaging and email platforms.
4. Perforce-  enhances seamless team collaborationthrough Helixcore,support both centralized ad distributed developement workflows.
5. AWS CodeCommit-its hosts secure and scalable private Git repositories. 
6. Microsoft Team Foundation Server- developed by microsoft, it can keep trackof work items to find defect,requirements, and scenarios in a project.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
1. planning from execution to delivery
2. oversee the software development team
3. delegating work effectively
4. monitoring progress and tracking roadblocks
5. managing the deployment deliverables.

Challenges
1. lack of accountability
2. Unrealistic deadlines
3. Poor communication
4. inadequate resources
5. lack of riskk management skills
6. budget constraints
7. poor leadership
8. keeping up with changing requirements.
9. Unclear project goals.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
software maintenance-this is the proecess of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
a] corrective maintenance-this is fixing of defects
b] Adaptive maintenance- adapting it to the specific environments which is brought by changes to theoperating system.
c] perfective maintenance-this involes enhancing attributes.
d] preventive maintenance-helps to make changes and adaptations to software for it to work for longer period of time.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
these ethical issues are;
1. Privacy- software engineers must navigateto complex landscape of data collection, usage and protection.
2. intelectual property
3. accountability
4. copy right
